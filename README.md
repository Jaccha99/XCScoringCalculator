# XCScoringCalculator
This project will take an input of race times at a cross-country meet and will output the total points for each team and determine who won.
The team with the least amount of points wins.
Scalable to any amount of teams and runners.
All times must be entered with the minutes, followed by a colon, then the seconds. Ex: 16:43
Duplicated times are okay as long as the duplicated times are from different teams.
